# Implementation Progress

This document tracks the progress of implementing the project restructuring plan.

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ Migrated core UI components from the original structure to the new organization (Button, Card, Dialog, etc.)
- ✅ Implemented missing UI components (Toast/Toaster, Tooltip, AlertDialog, Popover, DropdownMenu, etc.)
- ✅ Created comprehensive error handling utilities
- ✅ Set up testing infrastructure with Vitest and React Testing Library
- ✅ Connected authentication flow with new structure
- ✅ Migrated API endpoints to new structure
- ✅ Updated project configuration for new structure
- ✅ Fixed hook implementations (useToast, useMutation, useForm, useAuth, etc.)
- ✅ Implemented example components to demonstrate UI components and hooks
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation for UI components and hooks
- ✅ Developed a component showcase page to demonstrate all components
- ✅ Set up consistent API client layer for all endpoints
- ✅ Created query hook factory for consistent data fetching

## In Progress

- ⏳ Implementing remaining feature-specific components
- ⏳ Adapting pages to use the new component structure
- ⏳ Updating server-side API implementations to match client expectations

## Next Steps

1. Complete the implementation of data display components (tables, virtualized lists)
2. Implement the remaining layout components (grid, container, flex)
3. Finish adapting all pages to use the new component structure
4. Update server-side API implementations to match client expectations
5. Conduct end-to-end testing of the containerized application
6. Optimize Docker images for production deployment
